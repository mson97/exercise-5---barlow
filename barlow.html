				<p>
					Barlow was designed by Jeremy Tribby in San Francisco, California.<br>
					Barlow was inspired by the look of California street signs, public transportation, and license plates. <br>
					It comes in three widths and nine different weights, making it extremely versatile. <br>
					Thus, Barlow can is suitable for large or small texts and in digial or print forms. <br>
					We aren't quite sure what websites use Barlow as it was released fairly recently. <br>
					One website that uses Barlow is the creator's demo website for the font. <br>
					<a href="https://tribby.com/fonts/barlow/#story">Check it out!</a> <br>
					From the website's interactive specimen, you can view the many possible iterations of Barlow.

				<p>
					What we like best about Barlow is how thin and readable it is. <br>
					It's a sans-serif font that is both clean and simple, making it suitable for professional and casual uses. <br>
					There is ample spacing within and between letters, making it very pleasing to the eye.	<br>
					We do think that Barlow is quite plain and is not attention grabbing. <br>
					It is quite similar to other existing fonts such as Roboto or Open Sans. <br>
					Our least favorite thing about Barlow is the ugly capital Q. <br>
					Barlow is definitely has a minimalistic, simple, and modern personality. <br>
					Barlow does not have an extensive history of usage due to how new it is. <br>
					However, an interesting fact about this font is that it is named after John Perry Barlow, a pioneer in the internet. <br>
